# Breakout
In Breakout, the initial configuration of the world appears as shown on the right. The colored
rectangles in the top part of the screen are bricks, and the slightly larger rectangle at the
bottom is the paddle. The paddle is in a fixed position in the vertical dimension, but moves
back and forth across the screen along with the mouse until it reaches the edge of its space.
