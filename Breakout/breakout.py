----------------
Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. It was designed
by Steve Wozniak, based on conceptualization from Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow who were influenced by the
seminal 1972 Atari arcade game, Pong. The look and feel of this game has been inspired heavily from when the game was
first released on May 13, 1976, with a slight modern touch added to it. This program was the Final Project of CS106A.
